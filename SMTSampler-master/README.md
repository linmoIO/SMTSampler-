# Update

You may also want to also check out our new project [GuidedSampler](https://github.com/RafaelTupynamba/GuidedSampler), which is an extension of SMTSampler for coverage-guided sampling of solutions.

# Building

Install dependencies

```
sudo apt install git g++ make python-minimal
```

Clone repos

```
git clone https://github.com/RafaelTupynamba/SMTSampler.git
git clone https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.git
```

Build z3 (with a patch to compute the coverage of a formula)

```
cd z3
git checkout bb7ad4e938ec3ade23282142119e77c838b1f7d1
cp ../SMTSampler/z3-patch/mk_util.py scripts/mk_util.py
cp ../SMTSampler/z3-patch/rewriter_def.h src/ast/rewriter/rewriter_def.h
cp ../SMTSampler/z3-patch/model.cpp src/model/model.cpp
cp ../SMTSampler/z3-patch/permutation_matrix.h src/util/lp/permutation_matrix.h
python scripts/mk_make.py
cd build
make
sudo make install
cd ../..
```

Build SMTSampler

```
cd SMTSampler
make
```

# Running

Simply run with

```
./smtsampler -n 1000000 -t 3600.0 --smtbit formula.smt2
```

SMTSampler will create a file `formula.smt2.samples` with the samples generated and print statistics to standard output. The file `formula.smt2.samples` has one line for each produced sample. The first number represents the number of atomic mutations which were used to generate this sample. Then, the sample is displayed in a compact format.

The option -n can be used to specify the maximum number of samples produced and the option -t can be used to specify the maximum time allowed for sampling.

Three different strategies can be used for sampling, as described in the paper. With option `--smtbit`, we add one soft constraint for each bit inside a bit-vector. With option `--smtbv`, only one soft constraint is added for each bit-vector. Finally, option `--sat` encodes the SMT formula into SAT and performs the sampling over the converted SAT formula.

All the samples that SMTSampler outputs are valid solutions to the formula.

# Benchmarks

The benchmarks used come from SMT-LIB. They can be obtained from the following repositories.
